# Main deployment components

-	Corosync/Pacemaker manifests
-	Haproxy with conf.d patch + manifests
-	NS contained resources

Note:

In order to get all of the aforementioned components set up and deployed we added or modified several deployment pieces and modules along with other software.

These were:

1.	Puppet-corosync module originally created by puppetlabs and modified by us
2.	We also needed Haproxy version that supports configuration directory includes in order to inject changes to haproxy in granular manner
3.	Modified VIP and Haproxy OCF resources to contain haproxy and IP addresses inside specific namespaces
