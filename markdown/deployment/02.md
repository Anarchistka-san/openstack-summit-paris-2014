Corosync/pacemaker manifests: part 1
====================================

-	Not all resource types supported
	-	Constraints (e.g. location) support
	-	Master/slave resources not supported
-	Puppet service type provider for pacemaker
-	[5.1 release] asymmetric cluster:
	-	services stopped everywhere by default
		-	enabled by 0 location constraint
		-	clones started locally
		-	primitives started only once
-	Shadow approach broken => Moved to xml patches instead

Note:

First of all, we needed to polish some of the corosync module code that we had at the time we forked it. This were additional support for other pacemaker resources In order to deploy pacemaker resources and to maintain almost the same code we needed to implement pacemaker service provider for puppet. This provider was not perfect as it was triggering restarts not only for the services on the particular node being deployed but globally, e.g. for clone resources each resource was restarted. So we switched to asymmetric cluster and refactored service provider to perform actions locally.
