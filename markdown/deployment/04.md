Corosync/pacemaker manifests: part 3 - HA scalability
==================================================
- Multicast problems =>
  switched  to unicast by default 
- Need to alter and restart corosync => pacemaker maintenance mode
- Galera transitional sync => Limit on parallel controllers


Note:
 So as soon as we won a fight for deployment stability we moved to scalability and
 here is what we faced: we received initial feedback from our services guys that
 most of our customers do not have multicast enabled or correctly configured.
 This made us switch deployment to unicast one by default. And this was what really
 saddened us because we had to alter corosync configuration and restart it each time
 we wanted to add a new controller. In order to make it work we modified init scripts
 for corosync to check for pacemaker and put it into maintenence mode.
 Also, we needed to limit amount of parallel controllers being deployed in order not
 to exhaust donor nodes and affect working environment.
